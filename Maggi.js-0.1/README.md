Maggi.js
========

Maggi.js is a Javascript framework that enables rapid development of modern web applications using an object-centric client-server model.

* Maggi.db.js, a client-server infrastructure \"maggically\" syncing objects live on multiple clients persistantly with a cloud-server.
* Maggi.UI.js, a model-model framework for \"maggically\" generating responsive web-client user-interfaces from a data model and a user-interface model.
